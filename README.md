CustomMaps

A combination of tools to make custom Google Maps by Paul Beard

I am a former professional Analyst/Programmer who writes JavaScript like VB6 and VB6 like COBOL!

See "CustomMaps.docx" for a fuller description of the project details.

mapfromjsxml.html
This HTML/JavaScript application takes data from a file "Map.js"  and draws markers on a map in all major browsers using GoogleMaps API v3. 

MS Excel
A macro-enabled MS Excel spreadsheet may be used to prepare the data for the XML file in a user-friendly way. An example is contained in the file "MapXMLExample.xlsm"
